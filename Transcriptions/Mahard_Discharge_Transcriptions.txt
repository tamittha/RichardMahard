Dear Dick:


Your good letters of January 14 and January 25 were thoroughly enjoyed by us. It was very kind of you to take the time.


 I was [especially] glad to hear of all the things you told me about. I am afraid I will not be able to give you anything as interesting in return. I am sorry to say that your new acquaintance Mr. Wolf Latajenski is not listed in American Men of Science.


We had not heard that Scherm and Virginia are not going to Tokyo. He probably sent the films on to you because I have not received them from him. I took your letter to the Eastman Kodak Co. to Mr. Stuart. He was laid up with a cold but I left the letter with one of his assistants along with a note explaining the urgency of your need. I earnestly hope it will get results. 


I am pleased to hear that you may be changed or perhaps have been changed by this time to the Geology Section of the Mineral Resources Survey. I suppose I have not used the correct title but I trust that my meaning is obvious.


Before this time you have surely received a letter from Dr. Brown inquiring as to your likelihood of being released by next September and of the plans you have in mind for that time. I believe he asked that you reply directly to me since he is apt to be in California until around March 10. I shall be interested in your letter. 


I am sure I shall need help very badly next session. As you may recall there were 73 in General Geology. There were actually 75 enrolled but one dropped on September 20 and the other on October 1. Between the latter date and the end of the semester, February 2, not a student left the course or failed to take the final examination. That is an unusual record. Likewise Geography 121 which had 62 students from September until the end of the semester. We normally expect something of a drop in each of these courses. Last year there was a net loss in 112 of 12 students, 58 the first semester, 46 the second. This year the net loss is 4 and I have 69. The Geography class actually gained one and I now have 63. As a matter of fact I don’t suppose we received the normal increase in men because they were not admitted to these courses without consent.


Mario[?]n, I am sure has doubtless told you of the greatly increased enrollment of men. There are now over 250, and about 610 girls. 


At least we have decided to take the spring vacation field trip with a party of about a dozen students and with Dean Richards and his wife and my wife and me. Mr. Norman Thomas, a very successful oiled geologist of the class of 1920, was here today.

Dear Richard:


Your good letter of December 4 written from Tokyo reached me day before yesterday. That was just 10 days. I also acknowledge with gratitude your letter of December 31 from Guam and the one on December 18 from Hamilton Field.


I filled out and sent in some time ago the recommendation to the committee on National Research Council fellowships. I was very pleased to hear that you had an enjoyable week in California. I can see that the use of a car would add greatly to your pleasure. It was splendid that you were able to see Professor Rogers. He did not come to the G.S.A. meeting at Pittsburgh. We enjoyed very much the description you gave us of your trip to Guam in the letter written from that place. It is too bad that you were unable to secure color film before leaving San Francisco, and I have no better luck here. Mr. Stuart again suggested that it might do some good if you would send a letter addressed to Eastman Kodak Company to me. This letter will then be given to Mr. Stuart, who will send it to Eastman. It may not do any good but I would surely try it. I would ask for at least a dozen rolls explaining that you have the chance of a lifetime to get pictures which will be very useful to you and your students.


I found two old color films which I did not use before their normal date of expiration, but I have used films older than these before with splendid success and I would surely shoot these out. I sent these two along with four new black and white ones which I secured from Mr. Stuart to Sherman Neuschel in accordance with your instructions. I sent in the same package the original booklet of instructions that came with the camera. 


We were very much interested in your description of your arrival in Tokyo and we are particularly pleased that you are comfortably situated. I hope very much that you will be assigned more important work than[ink scribbly over n]  typing and that you will be able to get around the country.


We have had a week and a half of school since the Christmas recess. Most of the students came back in good shape, although some [there is] illness which seems to be a recurrence of flu or at least the after-effects. An epidemic such as we had has results which are not beneficial. Dr. Brown said at convocation that we would probably have sixty to eighty veterans at the beginning of the second semester. I suspect that figure includes a few civilian freshmen who will enter at that time. Our basketball team, which is composed entirely of civilian students of course, is having rough sledding. They are doing pretty well but not well enough. Last night Denner Mahood spoke on “Novels of Two World Wars” before the Denison Society of Arts and Letters. In spite of the long Christmas recess we still haved three full weeks before examinations start on January 26. The Executive Council extended the second semester two days so that registration falls on February [-? crossed out] 1 instead of Monday, February 4. I do not expect as many in 122 as I have in 121, and there will be a falling off also in 112. So far as I know, there will be no advanced students next semester. Don Eschman writes home that he may get out about June 1, in which case we will try to get him into the Wyoming course.


The G.S.A. meeting at Pittsburgh was fine. Tom Bates and Sherman Neuschel were there and Virginia Neuschel came for Saturday morning. She spent Thursday and Friday with her mother here in Granville. There were about 900 registered, and we were most comfortably accommodated on the seventeenth floor of the William Penn Hotel. All the meetings were held on one floor and my wife and I had our room on the fifteenth. All the eating facilities are on the first floor and the lower lobby. We missed a number of older men whose familiar faces were remembered through the period ending in 1941. We missed Austin Rogers, Professor Berkey, A.C. Lawson, Professor Johnson and many, many others. The two venerable figures [illegible addition to text] were Hobbs and Darton. Mr. and Mrs. Stose were also there. In the business session there was a considerable discussion of the policies of the G.S.A. as regards expansion of membership and coordination of the geological societies. Several sessions were denoted to the contribution of geologists in in geological surveys and institutions in war. Professor Knopf reported on the activities of the Foreign Minerals Administration. I was amazed at the volume of importations. At the annual dinner the entertainment feature was the showing of pictures of Paracutin. 


We see Marion almost every day and know that she is getting along as well as could be expected. I just this minute called her by telephone as I was writing. I think it is splendid that she can be in Dean Richard’s office. 


There is no change in the status of Bob and Harold. 


With very cordial regards from Anna and me, I beg to remain
        
                                                Sincerely yours,

Friday, April 5, 1946


Dear Professor Wright,


                        I am determined that this day shall not pass without seeing this over-due letter to you in the mails. I’m very sorry that this answer to your good letters of Feb. 15 and Mar. 6, which have reached me since last I wrote, has been so long delayed; particularly sorry because I know you are anxious to have news concerning the matter in which we’re both so vitally interested. I’m certain, however, that Marian will have communicated to you and Dean Richards the most important single item of news which I cabled to her.


                        A week ago yesterday, Feb. 28, I handed the application for discharge to Colonel Northrup along with a personal letter explaining the situation and Dean Richard’s supporting letters. The Colonel examined the papers with some care and then very kindly voiced the opinion that he thought. “We should be able to put this thing through without any trouble!” Believe me I was pleased to hear that statement. The Colonel instructed me to prepare the “first indorsement” of the application and then he would sign it. He told me that the first paragraph of the indorsement should read simply “discharge approved”; he also indicated that I was to include a paragraph urging that action on the application be expedited to assure my release from the Army by August [ink smudge] Believe me I did not delay going to work to type out the necessary copies of the indorsement.


                        I should explain that I submitted the application to Colonel Northrup without Prof. Kerr’s letter being present. However as the application is written, Prof. Kerr’s letter is a part of it and will go in with the application to Washington. I proceeded in this fashion because I did not want to delay action on the Colonel’s part until after the arrival of Prof. kerr’s letter (I’m hoping that Prof. Kerr’s letter will arrive today or tomorrow inasmuch as it was probably mailed about March 25).


                        Right at the moment further action on the application is being held up because a necessary statement concerning my military record has not arrived from the Personnel Division here. This statement or clearance must go in to Washington with the first indorsement. The request for the statement went in to Personnel just a week ago today; I suspect action it being delayed because they haven’t been able to find my records (there seems to be a rule in the Army - a seldom ever violated rule - that all records have to be lost or misplaced for a period of time whenever action on those records is necessary).


                        To sum up the situation - as soon as the clearance comes from Personnel and as soon as Prof Kerr’s letter arrives, the application goes to Washington where further action will be taken (then will come the time for keeping fingers crossed!) However, I should say that I’m quite optimistic about the chances of success. I feel that it’s a real “break” that the final action on the application will be taken in Washington. I feel that it will receive more sympathetic treatment there because the men who take the final action will be more aware of the acute situation which exists with regard to a shortage of college instructors. If the application is approved in Washington, there are two ways they might proceed -1/ Washington might issue orders calling me back to duty at the Pentagon (Ft. Myer) and then carry through the discharge procedure there 2/ Washington might order this theatre to start me through the discharge channels here and I’d go through the mill with the rest of the eligibles. I’m inclined to think I’d prefer the former procedure. If I’m called back to Washington from here, my leaving here would be expedited and back in Washington I think action on the discharge procedures would work more smoothly. But then, at the moment there is little need to think about this matter!


                        I scarcely know what to say about the question concerning how long it will take Washington to take action on the application one way or the other. I can only make a guess. Assuming that Prof. Kerr’s letter and the memorandum from the Personnel Office arrive in time so that the papers can be sent here on or before April 15, they should arrive in Washington sometime around the first of May. Allowing a month for Washington to take action, I should have word with regard to the decision about the end of May. If the decision should be favorable, I might get away from here sometime in June and be out of the Army sometime in July. (It makes me feel good just to write that although I may be building myself up for an awful let down!)


                        I don’t know that there is mich more to say about this particular matter. I should express my heartfelt appreciation to you and Dean Richards for your aid and encouragement and for your willingness to give me this chance to try for the discharge. I’m sorry that the decision cannot be cooner known; I realize that it puts you and the Dean in a very uncomfortable position because plans - definite plans - for next Fall cannot be made. But, as I say, I personally feel optimistic about my chances.


                        I was very pleased to learn that you would be able to “run” the Spring Field Trip this year. You will have returned by the time you receive this. I sincerely trust the journey was a successful one and enjoyable. It was very nice that Mrs. Richards and the Dean could go along with you; I can imagine they thoroughly enjoyed the experience!


                        I want to say that the film has finally arrived here - the film which you sent so long ago to Sherm. Sherm arranged for it to be brought out by one of the men who recently came from the Survey out here to work. I am very well supplied with film now, and I scarcely think there is a reason for you to concern yourself more about supplying me with more. The Lt. Col. who is 2nd in command here at our office gave Ed Eakland and me a dozen rolls of Agfa color film the other day, and should we use it up, I’m certain he (the Col.) would be willing to get us some more. Actually, I have had relatively little opportunity lately to take pictures. I’m hoping to be able to get out in to the country during this next week or ten days where now, that spring is here, there should be mich interesting activity. The first of the cherry blossoms are now to be seen; I understand they’ve been delayed in blooming by unseasonably cold weather. 


I say I hope to be able to get out into the country within the next ten days for good reason, because today all of our officers left by plane for a trip to Okinawa, Manila, and Guam. They decided that they’d be able to take one of us along and so we flipped a coin to see who would go and Ed Eakand was the winner -  am glad for him and sorry for myself! But Larry and I are hoping that there will be other opportunities for us. The party will return about a week from Saturday. I instructed Ed to take duplicates of any particularly worthwhile pictures which he very willingly agreed to do.


 Larry was very pleased and relieved to learn last week that he had become the father of a daughter born March 28 -  perhaps Alice has told you. He bore up very well under the strain; I have felt very sorry for him these past few days because all the news he has had has been that in a couple of very short cables. 


Two weeks ago Larry had a chance to go on a three day week-end up to a lead-zine-iron mine north of the small city of Chichibu. Two of the men from the Mining and Geology division of the Natural Resources Section were going and Larry managed to get permission to go along. He had a very interesting time. He was terribly impressed with the country where the mine is located; says it’s more rugged that any mountain country of similar type he’s ever seen in the U.S. Larry says that the steepness of the slopes is almost impossible to believe - he says he measured several of them casually with his Brunton compass and found them to be between 40 and 45 degrees! There was no access road into the mine which could be travelled even by a jeep. The machinery in the rather large mill at the mine was all carried in by hand or rather dragged in by hand (Larry reports that he saw a piece of machinery being dragged along by the tail by a hand operated winch!) The concentrates from the mill are carried by aerial tramway for over nineteen miles to the rail head! No, the mine was not an obscure, unimportant operation; it is one of the leading lead-zine mines of this country! How tremendously hard these Japanese have to work for what they produce and how unbelieveably backward they are in many areas of endeavor. How they ever talked themselves into thinking that they could engage in a modern war with a power like the U.S. is beyond me.


Here at the office we have been doing very, very little and what we have done has been of practically no importance. The first six-months of the mapping program have elapsed and as far as I’m able to judge nothing of importance has been accomplished! The whole plan, of course, is still in the development stage, but it’s not developing very fast. I’m convinced that if some of the commercial aerial photography companies like Fair[-?]hild Surveys had been turned loose on this job right in the beginning, they’d have accomplished fifty times more than the Army has accomplished to date, and I doubt if it would have cost the American taxpayer much more!


Won’t this recent announcement concerning the release of Army Officers with two years of service as of August 31 assure Harold’s return to civilian status sometime this summer? I certainly hope that that’s the case! The way the Navy’s letting go of their personnel, I wouldn’t think Bob would have so long to go!


I’m very much interested in the reports from the United States concerning the number of men who are returning to the colleges. Isn’t it strange what a complete reversal in trend there has been from the time shortly after V-E day - although some of the reasons for the change are obvious. You may have heard that there was a group of American Educators over here in Japan studying the Japanese educational problems. While that mission was here, I heard several of them speak at forums held by the American Veterans Committee (am not interested in this organization - only in their forums). The two most outstanding speakers were Dr. George Stoddard, now Commissioner of Education of New York State and President Elect of the U. of Illinois and Dr. T.V. Smith, Philosophy Dept, U. of Chicago. These two men had some very interesting things to say about post-war education and educational problems. I should say Dr. George Counts of T.C., Columbia also spoke at one of the forums. He made an interesting analysis of education in the Soviet Union on which he apparently is an expert!


I have just returned from the post office, among other letters, was yours of March 27. I was glad to have your word about the letter which you wrote to Prof. Kerr. I shall be anxiously awaiting his letter. As I bring this to a close, I shall think of you among the valleys and hills of your much-loved Virginia. My best regards to Mrs. Wright and to you and to all.
                                                Most cordially yours,

Dear Professor Kerr:


        Larry Craig tells me that he has recently written to you, but I’ll add a few words to his version of the story of our Tokyo interlude.


        Very close to 21/2 months have elapsed since our arrival here and in that time we have probably done a week’s worth of work! Of course I should add that that week’s work could have been done more effectively by another office - an office whose personnel wonders why we’re here almost as much as we do. It should be said, however, that our Colonel and his buddy have been in Washington for the past month and it might be that when they return we’ll be somewhat busier even though the work we do will be a duplication of some other office’s effort! But in the Army if only two offices are doing the same thing the efficiency can be said to be at a high peak!


        The dreams we had of transferring to Tom Hendrickk Mining and Geology Division of Colonel Schenok’s Natural Resources Section has faded into oblivion. Dr.. Hendricks has made up most of the defiolenoise in his personnel by recruiting discharged officers and enlisted men who agree to stay on here here in this theatre  for a period of six months or more. Some of these men have had a very limited education and little experience but they are making them do.


        I;m sure that Larry told you that Tom Hendricks recently sent Larry’s name in to the Survey hoping that Larry might be among the ones for whom the Survey will request discharges. Apparently the Survey expects to be granted a very large appropriation to accomplish geological work requested by various government agencies and to do this work with the Survey will need more men than are available hence the attempt to “salvage” some personnel, from the Army cesspool.


        Dr. Hendricks was very willing to forward my name to the Survey also, but I explained to him that I was expecting to try for a discharge sometime in the near future on the basis of having been a college instructor. I am informed by the American Council on Education that such discharge applications, when supported by a letter from the college involved, are accepted and considered by the Army under Army Regulation 615-365, paragraph 3B (the so-called National Health and Safety regulation). I am right at the moment anxiously awaiting a reply from Denison concerning this matter (lately it has been taking mail over a month to come from the states to here), but I am confident that they will supply me with the supporting letter.
        
        For several days I have had all composed a cable addressed to you and have been wondering whether to send it. Yesterday I made up my mind to do so and by the time you have this letter, you will have had the cable at hand for several days. My I say right now how grateful I am for whatever action you see fit to take regarding it. My thought at the moment is to submit my application for discharge around the last of April (at which time I will have completed one year in the Army). Allowing two months for the decision to be made and for the discharge to be accomplished (if the decision is in my favor), I would still have two months (July and August) to get a start on the field work in California - a start which would enable me to very much more effectively pursue “office” and library work during the academic year. With this possibility in mind (accomplishing two months of field work this summer) I am asking you for a letter testifying to my intent to support my discharge application and to supplement Denison’s letter.


        I have no idea whether the application for discharge will be successful or not. I know of no way to find out except to try. The fact that I’m in a foreign theatre of operations may complicate the matter. Marian writes me that she knows of a high school instructor in Granville who got out on this AR 615-365 without difficulty so these’s some reason for hope. 
        
        I think you’ll be interested to hear that I have actually been doing some “field” work on the Halls Flat Quadrangle. It’s a long range effort, but I have rather carefully gone over the quadrangle attempting to gleam some information by means of map interpretation procedures. I am enthusiastic about my progress so far; I have located several of the more crucial areas I’ll want to investigate when I first arrive in the region and have tried to do some thinking, make some noise, and arrive at some “multiple hypotheses” concerning the structure as they are depicted by the contours. My whole effort I realize is even worse than “train window” geology but it's the best I can do under the circumstances.
        
        Just a word before closing concerning our stay here. Three weeks ago I managed to take a trip down to Kyoto which proved to be very interesting. From the train we were able to see something of the techniques of the Japanese system of land utilization which, I personally think is one of the most astounding efforts of man I’ve ever seen. It’s simply impossible to describe how hard these people work to make the land at their disposal yield to its utmost. The railroad from Tokyo to Kyoto runs very close to its base of Mt. Fuji and fortunately the weather was fine and we had many views of that magnificent volcanic peak. After seeing that mountain it’s not difficult to understand why the Japanese consider it saored. There has been talk about the offices here several times concerning an expedition to climb Fuji (it’s by no means a difficult feat) but so far it hasn’t worked out. I hope that later in the spring we’ll manage to make the trip.
        
        One of the fellows in the Natural Resources Section (John Rogers) has just returned from a survey of the phosphate resources of various of the Pacific Islands. He made an informal oral report of his findings and various adventures last Saturday night. We were invited to attend and had a very interesting evening. We’re lucky that although our tasks here have little or nothing to do with geology, we’re able to hear something of the geological work others are doing and thus keep our interest alive.


        This week end we’re hoping that the weather is going to be good because one of the Captains is our office, who is a pilot, has arranged to obtain a plane and he’s going to take us on a flight down to see the “atomized” city of Hiroshima. It’s a marvelous opportunity for us and I hope the weatherman is good to us!


        I sincerely hope that this finds you and yours in the best of health and spirits. I trust that things are rapidly getting back to normal around the Department - it must seem very good indeed to have numbers of people around once more. Larry and I shall always be grateful for any support you may feel you can give to this discharge application of mine.


                
                        Cordially yours,

Thursday, February 21, 1946        
Dear Professor Wright,


                Day before yesterday, 19 days after it was postmarked, I received the President’s letter concerning my possible return to Denison. That typical of the mail service we’re getting these days. It is said that scarcely a one of the letters which we send via air mail actually travel by air across the ocean. The Armysays that they have no personnel to man the planes and no qualified mechanic to service them. The men here in the theatre, however, are very reluctant to swallow that story and more and more they’re griping and complaining. I had it on very good authority last Sunday that there are 50,000 bags of mail stored in a warehouse in Hokohama because there is no one to load it. I’m certain that if that’s true, the Army could obtain a thousand volunteers in an hour to put it on the ships. A friend here at the office received a package which had been sent “first class” the other day; it was mailed in Kansas City on Dec. fifth.


                Because the mail is so very slow I sent a cable to you on Feb. 19 to the effect that the answer to the President’s letter which I would make is already contained in a letter which I sent to Dean Richards on February 8. In that letter I indicate to the Dean that I am very anxious to return to Denison in the fall, and I also sent to him the “dope” from the American Council on Education concerning the procedure necessary to secure the discharge of a former instructor. I personally am required to make the application for discharge, but I must have a letter from the college indicating that there is a position for me and indicating also something of the difficulty of hiring someone to fill the vacancy.
        
                I have no idea whether or not an application for discharge will “go through” successfully. I know of no way of finding out except to try. It is my thought to make the application in April when I will have completed about a year of service. If the application should be turned down, I still think there is a chance I’ll qualify for discharge toward the end of the summer. Much depends upon what Congress does with the Selective Service measure and with the Universal Military Service act. I appreciate fully that you at Denison are put in a difficult position if you cannot know until almost the last weeks whether I can return. I sincerely wish I knew the solution to this particular aspect of the problem, but I am baffled.


                May I elaborate further my thinking concerning the future. If I am not free until too late to begin the 1946-47 academic year, I shall at the earliest opportunity pursue the work on my dissertation, pushing it through to completion before September, 1947 in order that I would be ready, degree in hand, to take a position at that time. The application I made for the National Research Council fellowship was [laced with this contingency in mind. However, as I say, my first choice is to return to teaching this autumn if possible. This can be interpreted as more “putting off” of the dissertation work. That is not true. It is trite to say but my greatest desire is to get back to “normal” after this stay in the service. I want to be back to a job again; I want to have the feeling of security which comes with knowing I have a home and a place in the scheme of things. During the year I would carry forward library work on my dissertation and make preparations for a full summer of field work in 1947.


                Day before yesterday a new announcement was made concerning the release of men from this theatre. The 42-44 “pointers” start to move to the replacement depot Feb. 22 for shipment home and discharge. Also moving to the depot soon will be men with twenty-four months of service as of June 30, 1946. In other words, men with 20 months service as of the current date become elgible. If 20 month men move soon, will 16 month men be moving by August? If so, that will catch me. Do you have any news of significance? What men are being discharged from U.S. camps?


                It just occurred to me that it might be possible for you and the President and the Dean to obtain an idea of the success or failure of applications for discharge made by former instructors if you wrote or telegraphed the American Council on Education. I should be much interested in any news which they might have and would contact them myself if communication were easier than it is from here.


                I must close now. I spent last week-end in Kyoto and had an interesting time. I wrote the story of my experiences and sent it to Marian and I asked her to send it on to you.


                I know, Professor Wright, that I can depend on you to handle this difficult situation with sympathy and understanding, and I am very grateful for the great consideration you have at all times shown.


                My very best regards to Mrs. Wright and to you,


Very cordially yours,

Dear Dean Richards,


                        This is a somewhat difficult letter to write. I’m not certain it’s entirely fair to address it to you, but I shall nevertheless do so. I shall send it to you as a friend whose advice and counsel I value highly.


                        As you suspect the letter deals with the problems concerned with my release from the Army and with regard to the possibility of my returning to Denison as an instructor.


                        First may I explain my present feelings regarding the matter. Quite frankly I want to return to teaching next autumn, and I want to return, if at all possible to Denison. I want that more, I believe, than I’ve ever wanted anything. I’m at the point right now of thinking I’d do almost anything to make that possible and I scarcely dare think that it might not come to pass. I know you can understand how being in the Army causes one to feel this way. Almost everyone I know has a comparable attitude. Their one dream - dreamed constantly - is to return to the way of living they enjoyed before entering the service. I recognize that my wishing to be back is not based entirely on clear objective thinking, but recognizing this fact helps little to make the wish less great.


                        Concerning my chances for discharge before school begins in September, I hardly know what to say. The two-year men unquestionably will be out by July 1 (26 month men are clearing here now). All rumors seem to say that length of service before release will be brought down to 18 months and then held there. I’ll have 12 months service on April 23 - 18 months, October 23. During these next few weeks Congress will have much to say. The move to discharge fathers is a strong one (this very day “Stars and Stripes” ran a story saying that the Army plans to release 580,000 fathers by July 1). If this plan is carried through (and I for one think it certainly should be), it will lessen the chance of married men with no children and single men to be released after a shorter period of service. Failure of Congress to vote for the continuation of Selective Service or compulsory military training law would hurt the chance of men already in service. As usual one can only conclude that plans are extraordinarily difficult to make in the face of fear of the undertanties mentioned above.


                That brings me to thematter I talked over with you last fall. At long last I’ve managed to lay hands on theBulletin of the American Council on Education which outlines the procedure to be followed to try for the discharge of former college instructors. I inclose a copy of this bulletin. 


                I would ask first whether you or President Brown would be willing to write the necessary letter for me and second would you feel you could justify writing the letter? Professor Wright, of course, enters the picture. Last fall he seemed very willing that an attempt be made to obtain my discharge. I have no reason to think that he has changed his mind. Incidentally, Prof. Wright does not know I’m writing this letter and I have not written to him about the American Council Bulletin.


                Here are my thoughts regarding this matter. I feel that if I’m going to apply for a discharge it would be well to wait until April. By then I will have served approximately one year and by then the information may be somewhat more complete with regard to the Army’s discharge policy. By April I will either have gotten settled down in my present job or I will have been transferred to another task. I realize fully that as far as you [-?]t Denison are concerned there are difficulties in this plan. If I apply for discharge in April, the action on the case may be delayed a couple of months and that means you would be kept from hiring someone else at the normal time. It all more or less boils down to the single question – “How long will you at Denison be willing to wait for my situation to clear up before hiring someone to take my place in the Autumn?”


                I should like to make mention of the matter of my unfinished degree. If I am not discharged in time to be back at teaching by September, 1946, I shall just as soon as I’m released, desire to to to work on my dissertation planning to complete it before September, 1947 at which time I’d be ready for a position armed with the degree. This period of study would be made somewhat difficult by financial problems but there is reason to hope that with “G.I. Bill of Rights” money and additional aid from Columbia such a program could be carried forward. If I should be back by this coming September I would plan to carry the work on my dissertation forward during the year completing the field work during summer ‘47.


                You have been kind, Dean Richards, to bear with this letter this long. I’ll not make it longer. I shall be more than grateful for any answer you may give, and I thank you sincerely for your consideration past and present.


Very truly yours,

        Dear Dick:


Dr. Wright came by my office this morning, and we had a good conference on the work of his department. We reviewed together my letter to you, dated October 30th, and I hope that you will take this letter inconjuction with that one, because the two really are one.


As I wrote you, we very definitely must have a second man in the Department of Geology next year. You know the high regard that Dr. Wright and I have for you, and you are probably aware, too, of your legal right to return to Denison for a year inasmuch as you were on the faculty when you went into the service. 


You will easily appreciate the need that Dr. Wright has of making plans for next year as rapidly as that is possible. I am writing this letter to ask if you will tell us in an early reply just what your own plans are, so far as you are able to make them. Do you have a definite reason for believing that you can secure your release from the service by summer? If you do, is it your thought that you would make use of your GI educational right to go on at once for your doctor’s degree, or would you hope to return to teaching?


It is possible that I shall be in California when your reply comes, and therefore I am suggesting that you address it to Dr. Wright, and I shall ask him to share it with me when I return. 


Be assured that I write in hearty friendship. I hope the Japs are all behaving properly and not giving you too much headache.


Most sincerely yours,

OFFICE OF THE

Dear Dick,


I apologize for my long delay in answering your good friendly letter of September 19th. I enjoyed it at the time and expected to answer promptly, but needed first to talk with Dr. Wright, and these four or five weeks have gone by before such a conference was held. It was only this afternoon that he spent some time in my office, going over the problem with me.


In the meantime, I think you have heard from Dean Richards that there is nothing at the present time which the College can do in getting release for a faculty man. That seems to be the best advice we have. I tried desperately twice to get a man out of the Navy, a man whom we very much needed for Maurice Myers’ place. Each time my request was refused.


It would not be possible to urge your return the second semester on the grounds of your being needed inasmuch as the Board of Trustees is not willing for a substitute salary to be added to the budget, and therefore Dr. Wright is going to have to forego his leave at the present time. I don’t know whether you knew or not, but the leave was originally granted, as were all leaves for 1945-46 as well as for ‘46-’47, on the condition that they not entail any additional expense to the budget.


It is true that we shall have to have a second man in Dr. Wright’s department beginning next September. He and I had a delightful time this afternoon, going over with care the profile of your teaching as reported in the students in their faculty study last April. I am happy to tell you that it was a very splendid complimentary profile in which on practically every score you came out above the average of the faculty for Denison. On one question you stood exactly at the average, and in one you were a little below. That is evidence enough, for both Dr. Wright and me, of the quality of your teaching. As for your friendliness, personality, character, and all that, you and Marian have fitted beautifully into the Denison life, and we have no doubt that you would fit into it in the same gracious way if you were to return.


Frankly, the two points on which Dr. Wright and I have some concern are the matter which I think he raised with you before you left, namely, interest in research and the kind of professional ambition that drives you into doing the extra during your free hours that will bring national recognition. We have had these in the Department of Geology, and both Dr. Wright and I would like to retain them.


I think first and foremost is your job of finishing the thesis. Would there be any possibility that you could get released from the army by Christmas time with the thought that you would spend the entire winter, spring, and summer gathering material for your thesis and preferably writing it? I am frank to say that both Dr. Wright and I would be impressed by such an effort if it could be made. Let me add by way of parenthesis that I fully recognize that your degree has been delayed in large part at least, by the demands of war teaching. 


It seems best at the moment not to make any definite commitments for next September, and yet I think I know Dr. Wright’s mind sufficiently to say that it is by no means closed to the possibility of your return. He has one or two men he wants to investigate as to whether or not they are available. In the meantime, if there are any developments in your plans, please keep us fully informed, and particularly so, if there is any possible chance that you could get out and get started on your thesis.


Of all the friends I have in the service, I think you have been the most unfortunate in terms of the army’s complete failure to make use of your special abilities. It has its humorous aspects, but it is essentially tragic to see the army going along its traditional way of inefficiency at a time like this. 


I have written frankly, and I think you will appreciate my directness. At the same time, please believe that I write with a wealth of friendship and good feeling for you. If it is possible for you to come back with Dr. Wright’s full approval, I should be very happy to welcome you.


Again my congratulations on the splendid profile on your teaching at Denison.


Please give my hearty good wishes to Marian. 




                                                        Sincerely yours,

Dear Dick,
        
                It was good to hear from you and I’m sorry to take so long in getting this off. It’s disgusting to think of you and Larry in the army and I hope it won’t be for long. How the army can be so dumb and still win wars is beyond me. I think it will be the last they win unless they start releasing and deferring scientists.


                I’m enclosing a copy of the information I think you want. I hope it may help you. I saw Herb Kellogg up here last week-end and he is still in and has heard nothing about possible discharge. However he is pretty young and the situation may be different.


                Please give my very best regards to Larry. A fellow by name of Smith of the U.S.G.S. dropped into my office a month or so ago and told me Larry had been drafted. It made me so mad I’m afraid I didn’t keep my mind on the rest of the conversation very well. 


                If there is anything else I can do, Dick, please let me know. Please remember me to Marian, and best of luck.


                                                                        Sincerely,

Subject: Richard H. Mahard; Release requested.






My dear Sir:


The above named enlisted man was appointed to the faculty of Denison University in the Spring of 1941 as instructor in Geology. He is well qualified through native ability and special training for this position. Since his induction, following successful teaching of military trainees assigned to this campus, we have been unable to replace him. Many returning veterans are interested in furthering their education in his field. Qualified instructors in Geology are in serious shortage. We shall have to refuse registration for the term beginning September 5th, 1946, unless some means can be found of filling this vacancy on our staff.


In view of these facts I would respectfully urge your consideration of this man’s discharge as authorized in AR 615-365, Paragraph 3b, for I believe such action is important to national health, safety or interest.


Very truly yours,

RE: Pvt. Richard H. Mahrd, 35985568


Dear Sir:


        In view of the friendly relationship which has always existed between the Department of Geology at Columbia University and the Department of Geology at Denison University, I am writing to support the application of Pvt. Richard H. Mahard for a release from the Army.


        I have followed his work at Denison and have also kept in touch with his progress since he has been in the Army. It seems to me most important that he be released to take up his duties as an instructor at Denison. The colleges are being literally flooded with students, and Denison has no one to replace Pvt. Mahard. 
        
        Under the circumstances, instead of having an extra staff member to face a difficult situation, the college is short-handed. Therefore, it is to be greatly hoped that the technical training that Pvt. Mahard has acquired over a considerable number of years may be used to good advantage. In my estimation, the best possible way to accomplish this would be to allow him to return to Denison.


Respectfully yours,

Dear Dick:


You will probably receive a letter dictated a few days ago before this reply to your good letter of 8 February comes to hand. I am glad to have your letter to know that your propose to take steps to secure your release in order to return here in September. As a double check I am enclosing a letter to your Commanding Officer herewith (duplicate of letter dictated a few days ago) and a formal letter to you urging you to apply for release. You may wish to attach the latter to your application. I am also sending, or asking the President to send a copy of my letter to Dr. Francis J. Brown, American Council on Education, in order to get any pressure we can from that angle.


Dr. Wright has approved your plan of returning here next year and of deferring your field work until the next summer. We think it entirely unlikely that you will be released in time to do any field work in 1946 and shall be happy to have you back with us next fall.


Your letter of 8 February arrived March 17. I hope that mails are now being speeded up.


With all kind regards,

        Dear Dick:
        
I am still waiting for your leter referred to in your cable to Frank Wright. This morning Marian called my attention to the carbon of your letter to Frank, dated February 21st. On that basis I am enclosing the necessary request and trust that it may help to get your release. 


I do not need to commiserate with you and Marian on the mail situation except to say that I am glad to note in the papers recently that MacArthur is raising cane about it, nor do I need to regale you with tales of campus events, for I have no doubt that Marian writes rather frequently whether or not her letters are getting through.


We are all hoping that you can be with us by next fall, if not sooner. I shall be glad to hear what progress you are making. In the meantime, Alice would join me in all kind regards. I am going to leave the rest of this page for Marian to fill up as she wishes,

Dear Dick:


I am glad to have your descriptive letter of January 15. As a matter of fact my secretary has not kept me very well informed about your adventures. In fact, how am I to know that you have kept her well informed of them! Of course, she has told me that you had not yet gotten into the work for which you were ostensibly sent over, and I am happy to know that at the time you wrote it looks as if you were going to get a break. I certainly hope so. It’ll be good to hear from you again and to know in whatever detail you can relate just what the work involves. 


Your description of Japanese agricultural efforts is very interesting. Evidently they are faced with a major problem, particularly if their world markets are undercut by nylon, rayon, etc.


We are full to the eaves for this semester, and I don’t know what we’ll do for our married veterans next fall, unless the government comes through with the 50 units of housing we have applied for. We are in the position of refusing to accept men on transfer already, and by next fall shall be hard put to it to take care of all the Denisonians who want to return and leave room for anything like a normal class of entering freshmen. The veterans housing situation, in college and out, is a major headache all over the country, and of course we cannot afford to expand enormously as some of the state universities are planning to do to take care of the emergency.


I expect Marian is keeping you pretty well informed of events here in Granville, and I hope to have a general survey in the next Newsletter which will come out in about two weeks. In the meantime, Mrs. Richards would join me in kind regards. If Marian happens to transcribe this letter, I hereby give her leave to fill up the page with uncensored communication!
